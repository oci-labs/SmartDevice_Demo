Elasticsearch:

Bitnami Elasticsearch installed for nexmatixmvp-dev instance (presently v5.5.1-0).

Server info:  35.193.249.208
Region:  US-CENTRAL1-B

Username:  user
Password:

SSH Console via .pem file (should I add to repo?)

Elasticsearch instance name:  Bitnami-elasticsearch-dm-4538

Mappings:

- Mappings are what are used to create distinct indexes that can be used to create new documents and subsequently be searched against.
-- State (manifold status)
-- Config (valve configuration / details)
-- Alert (valve alerts)

Mapping files are located under the /Elasticsearch directory.  Defaulted to index all fields for this first pass.  This was done
by first ssh into the Elasticsearch instance, then using the Sense Chrome extension.

Of note, these cannot be updated, so new named indexes will need to be created (will investigate versioning, which apparently
went away with the release of Elasticsearch 5.x, as did automatic timestamps).
