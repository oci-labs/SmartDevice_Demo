After receiving the following message payload from the pub-sub topic, it needs to be parsed to prepare objects and store them as entities under respective datastore Kind's

{
	"manifold_sn": 1,
	"stations": [{
		"station_num": 0,
		"valve_sn": 2,
		"sku": "NX-DCV-SM-BLU-2-V0-L0-S0-00",
		"cc": 8,
		"ccl": 406351062,
		"pp": 125.0,
		"p_fault": "H",
		"leak": "N",
		"input": "B",
		"update_time": 1501615838081
	}, {
		"station_num": 4,
		"valve_sn": 0,
		"sku": "NX-DCV-SM-BLU-2-V0-L0-S0-00",
		"cc": 5,
		"ccl": 894379810,

		"p_fault": "L",
		"leak": "N",
		"input": "B",
		"update_time": 1501615839083
	}]
}

FOR EACH MESSAGE THE FOLLOWING INSERT/UPDATE STEPS ARE PERFORMED:

step-1: Insert Manifold object if not found, else update the timestamp (inserts 1 object or no object)

step-2: Insert Valve object if not found else update the timestamp(inserts <= total number of valve objects in the message)

*step-3: Find station with current Valve serial Number, if different than that of message, set old station to null and update the new station with current valve

step-4: Insert Valve status (inserts == number of valves in the message)


*Note: step-3 is little tidious task relative to others
